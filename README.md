# flight_delay_prediction
In this project, I was able to:
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to uncover insights such as:
  - Total number of flights per airlines
  - Better days to travel
  - Impact of delayed flights
  - Popular destinations with average airline delay
- Identify that Delta and Alaska Airlines are two of the most reliable airlines with the lowest number of delayed flights.
- Visualize the cleaned dataset using Tableau, creating an interactive dashboard with filters for easy data exploration.
- Utilize various predictive models including XGBoost, ADABoost, and Random Forest to forecast flight delays before they are displayed on the board.
- Compare the accuracy of the three prediction models and identify the one with the highest accuracy.

## Findings

- The analysis revealed that Delta and Alaska Airlines are the most reliable with the fewest delayed flights.
- The Tableau dashboard provides an intuitive and interactive way to explore the dataset visually.
- The predictive models allow us to anticipate flight delays, with XGBOOST achieving the highest accuracy.
