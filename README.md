# flight_delay_prediction
In this project I am  able to:
Perform EDA on the dataset and discover findings like Total number of flights per airlines, better days to travel, impact of delayed flights, popular destinations with average airline delay etc and visualize them.
Found that Delta and Alaska Airlines are two of the most reliable airlines with the lowest number of delayed flights.
Visualize the cleaned dataset on Tableau and create a dashboard with filters which made it easy to navigate through the columns of the dataset and helped exploring the data in a more visual and interactive way.
Predict if a flight will be delayed or not even before it is displayed on the board, using various models like XGBoost, ADABoost and Random forest prediction models.
Compare the accuracy of three different prediction models and found the one which helps providing the best accuracy.
